# RobotArm
This is the code for my Robot Arm project. Ideally, I will be able to plug in an electric vehicle car charger. Currently, I have some issues with the hardware, but the code seems to work great (though it is limited).

Note: This is a WPILib FRC project. I'm using FRC electronics and thus the FRC style of programming. Please see the "master" branch for the code that I started with, and "development" for my current developed code. Any additional developing I do is in a branch off of development. Once that task is completed, I will merge into development and delete that branch.
